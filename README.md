# AI Feasibility Study â€“ MCP, Agents & OpenAI Codex

> Exploring the feasibility of using AI agents, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and OpenAI Codex on GitHub to enhance developer efficiency and support business processes.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Evaluate **MCP** for exposing internal APIs as agent-ready services.
- Prototype **AI agents** (Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, Azure AI Agent) and measure their effectiveness.
- Explore **OpenAI Codex / GitHub Copilot** for developer productivity gains.
- Assess **security, compliance, and governance** aspects (aligned with EU AI Act, DORA).
- Provide a **cost, runtime, and efficiency model** for decision-makers.
